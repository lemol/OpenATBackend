    "main_description": "People who have totally lost the use of their muscles cannot operate their own wheelchairs. The Eyedrivomatic system takes advantage of existing eye tracking technology to allow users to drive their chairs again - using only their eyes. It's a low cost, open source way to give mobility back to people who thought they had lost it forever.It is intended for electric wheelchair users who have a wheelchair mounted pc which they operate using eyegaze equipment. Currently the system only works in conjunction with the grid2 aac package. However we are writing a stand alone pc application which should be ready before christmas. This instructable is about building the hardware needed for an eyedrivomatic system. Software installation and getting started will be covered in a separate instructable. Eyedrivomatic is an open project. Open source software and hardware. For more information, and links to the 3d design files and software, visit ..."
